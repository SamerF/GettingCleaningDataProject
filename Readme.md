* run_analysis.R: the only script needed to produce 2 data sets:
	- tidy.csv : 1st dataset that integrates Test data with Train data. 
 	- tidy2.csv: 2nd dataset (step 5 of the assignment) that provides the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

see CodeBook.md for more details on the columns

To run the script: copy the script to a local working directory that also contains the Samsung data.
then run these commands:
source("run_analysis.R")
